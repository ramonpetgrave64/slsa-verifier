# A workflow to run against renovate-bot's PRs,
# such as `make package` after it updates the package.json and package-lock.json files.
# The potentially untrusted code is first run inside a low-privilege Job, and the diff is uploaded as an artifact.
# Then a higher-privilege Job applies the diff and pushes the changes to the PR.
# It's important to only run this workflow against PRs from trusted sources, after also reviewing the changes!
